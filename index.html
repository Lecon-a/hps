I am indeed extremely thankful to God for seeing us through another successful academic year. I am also thankful to the parents of our wards for entrusting their precious angels to our care, tutelage and upbringing. I am immeasurably indebted to the reachers of Helpway Private School, Jos, for their hard work, diligence and commitment in ensuring that our pupils are nourished with the balanced diet of intellectual as well as Godly knowledge. As the Proprietress and Administrator of this school, our job has been principally to provide a positive nurturing learning environment where teachers and pupils can reach peak performance in the two-way teaching and learning process. I make bold to tell you that by God's special grace, we are living up to that responsibility...</p>
